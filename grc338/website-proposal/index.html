            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p> BuffBaby Boutique </p>
            
            <p> BuffBaby Boutique is growing small business that encourages and proudly supports the development of the designer toy market.  Our team at BuffBaby mainly focuses on creating products, in this case collectible figurines, that bring enthusiasm and joy into pop toy culture while promoting independent designers' art. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p> Collectors and investors with ages ranging from young children to the elderly seek after our products. These individuals appreciate the art form of the figures and enjoy collecting as a hobby. Friends and family can also purchase products as gifts! </p>
           
            <p> Toy collectibles can be scarce due to availability, and price usually depends on the condition, so there are investment assets to making a purchase. Since products are  limited individuals constantly check the site for product launches and collection drops. </p>
